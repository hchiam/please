# "Please" - a programming language

An experimental programming language that can read (i.e. parse) text generated by speech recognition software like Mac Dictation, so you can code by talking.

# Example code in "Please":

    Please print this string of words

When you run that code, it prints out:

    this string of words

Python has great readability, but I want to experiment with ease of code generation using speech recognition software. To make it utterances more natural yet concise, no special characters are necessary (like quotation marks) nor special keywords for special characters (like having to say "question mark" just to type out "?", which slow).

I.e., use only letters and the space character (the word 'spacebar' is recognized by Mac Dictation).

Each new sentence starts with "please" and roughly corresponds to a new command in code.

# Use:

Download this project, open the folder in Terminal/Commandline, and type:

    python interpreter.py text.txt

# Ideas for Development:

* ~~Try to be able to enter words that are likely to not be trained into Mac Dictation by default (like the word 'numpy'). How? Maybe use some kind of spelling convention, like using the first letters of the words 'neptune unicorn moose panda yak' --> 'numpy'.~~

* Try to map number strings to digits.

* Try to import existing python libraries like numpy.

* Try variables. Maybe something like 'variable apple' and 'variable apple equals one'.

* Try embedded expressions. Maybe use "thanks" as a closing bracket of sorts?

* Try trinket that loads most recent python code from github.
