# verbal_lang

I want to try to create a programming language that can use text generated by Mac Dictation.

Python is great, but I want to experiment with using text that doesn't use special characters (like quotation marks) that would require typing or special recognition by Mac Dictation.

I.e., use only letters and the space character (the word 'spacebar' is recognized by Mac Dictation).
